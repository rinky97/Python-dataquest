Count how many times each type of weather occurs in the weather list, and store the results in a new dictionary called weather_counts.

weather_counts = {}
for item in weather:
    if item in weather_counts:
        weather_counts[item] += 1
    else:
        weather_counts[item] = 1

{'Fog': 125, 'Fog-Rain': 4, 'Rain': 25, 'Sunny': 210, 'Thunderstorm': 1}
